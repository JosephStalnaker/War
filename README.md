# WAR GAME by Joseph Stalnaker

- Play the game of War
- Create a database called "war"
- In the terminal run 'npm run seed' to populate test profiles
- Begin running the app by running 'npm run start:dev' in the terminal
- Sign up and create a user profile with your username and password
- Once signed up play the computer by pressing deal
- The game is over when either player no longer has cards to play
- As a user check score history to see how many games you have won all time (at this time not funcional on the fron end)
